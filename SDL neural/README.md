In order to compile this project you must have the required libraries, stored in a folder called "Libraries", in the main directory of the project as shown below:

This image shows the contents of the folder. The DLLs folder is not necessary, I use it to keep track of 32/64bit DLLs from the libraries

In addition to having this libraries folder, glew32.dll,SDL2.dll and SDL2_mixer.dll from these libraries must be in the same directory as the compiled .exe in order to run the project
